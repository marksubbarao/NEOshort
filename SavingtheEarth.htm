<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='color:#C0504D'>1              Fly into
Meteor Crater</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About 50,000 years ago a large space rock crashed into the
Earth leaving behind this giant scar in the land nearly a mile across.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>2              Merge to panorama photo</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today Meteor Crater, which lies about 40 miles east of Flagstaff
Arizona, is a major tourist attraction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>3              Show overlay on panorama</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crater was produced by a meteorite 150 feet across. That
meteorite was metallic, composed of iron and nickel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>4              Gallery Timelapse</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know what it was made of, because we’ve found pieces of
it. One of them is on display here at the Adler, on loan from our friends at
the Field Museum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>TOUR </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>5              Fly out of Vredefort Crater</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We find evidence of past impacts all over the Earth. The
town of Vredefort South Africa actually lies with largest known impact basin -
one that is two hundred miles across and two billion years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>6              Fly in to Manicougan Crater</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This ring lake in Nova Scotia Canada is the result of an
impact that occurred 200 million years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>DANGER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>7              Fly to Park Forest showing Chicago</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all meteor impacts happen far away or long ago. In 2003
The Chicago suburb of Park Forest was hit. Each circle shows where a fragment
was recovered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>8              Park Forest Videos Overlay</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fireball was recorded by security and police cameras.
Let’s watch that again -- see how it lit up the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>9              Park Forest Strewn Field</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meteorites were recovered all over the area. The ones in
cyan weighed more than a pound, the one in yellow more than ten pounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>10           Jones House  infographic</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the largest pieces actually struck the home of the
Jones family. It pierced the kitchen ceiling, and went straight through the
floor into the basement where it bounced into a laundry basket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That meteorite is also on display here at the planetarium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>11           Chelyabinsk Fly in</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2013 an asteroid weighing about 14,000 tons entered the atmosphere
and exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='color:#C0504D'>12           Chelyabinsk
Videos overlay</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fireball and subsequent blast wave were well recorded on
amateur video. The explosion released 25 times the energy as the bomb dropped
on Hiroshima. Fortunately no one was killed, however 1,500 people did seek
medical attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>ORIGIN</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>13           Fly out to Chelyabinsk asteroid Orbit</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pulling away from Earth we can trace out the orbit of the
object that struck Chelyabinsk. We see that it goes out to the asteroid belt a
region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>14           Fly out to Asteroid Belt</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far we’ve mapped out the orbits of about half a million
asteroids, but there are many, many more waiting to be discovered. It looks
crowded here, but it isn’t like Stars Wars folks. If you were sitting on one
asteroid chances are you couldn’t even see another one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>15           Highlight NEOs</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of these asteroids pass close to Earth. For obvious
reasons we’d like to discover as many of them as possible. And once discovered
we need to determine their orbits so that we can identify any potential
threats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>ADLER
RESEARCH</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>16           Apache Point Observatory</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For that reason Adler Astronomer, Dr. Mark Hammergren is
leading a team of astronomers to observe Near Earth Objects using the 3.5m
telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1<i>7           Orbit Bundle</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our understanding of every asteroid’s orbit has some
uncertainty. This asteroid, with the catchy name 2014 WR365, was discovered
just before Thanksgiving last year. Its true orbit of this asteroid could have been
any of the red lines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After we observed it at Apache Point we were able to
significantly able to decrease the uncertainty in its orbit. Someday
observations like this may be critical in determining whether or not an
asteroid will strike us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>SOLUTION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='color:#C0504D'>18           Nukes in
Space</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what do we do if someday we detect an asteroid headed for
a collision course with Earth. If we can get to it early enough all we need to
do is nudge it into a different orbit – one that avoids the Earth entirely.
There are different ideas on how to do this: we might attach giant solar sails,
or fly an object nearby to give it a gravity assist. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But most effective might be to strike it with a nuclear bomb
and let the explosion push it out of its path of destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something like this…</p>
